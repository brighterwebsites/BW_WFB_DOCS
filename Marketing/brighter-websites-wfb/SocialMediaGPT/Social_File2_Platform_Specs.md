# Brighter Websites Social Media - Platform Specifications
**Platform-specific formatting, word counts, and technical requirements**

---

## FACEBOOK (Primary Platform)

### Format Requirements:
- **Word count:** 75 words (strict target—aim for 70-80 words)
- **Emojis:** 1-3 strategically placed (not overused)
- **Hashtags:** 3-4 relevant (placed at end after blank line)
- **Line breaks:** YES (use for scannability)
- **Link:** Shortlink only (https://bweb1.com.au/shortcode)

### Tone:
- Conversational like talking to a technical peer
- Can use "shit", "damn", "bloody" sparingly
- Questions work well for engagement
- Show real work, not just theory

### Structure:
```
[Hook - metric/problem/question in 1-2 sentences]

[Key insight or takeaway - 2-3 sentences]

[CTA with shortlink]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3 #Hashtag4
```

### Example Facebook Post (75 words):
```
Turns out 37 of our 199 pages weren't being indexed by Google. Not just 
slow—completely invisible.

The culprit? A single line in robots.txt that was blocking our entire blog. 
Took 3 hours of debugging with Screaming Frog to find it, but once we nuked 
that line, 35 pages got indexed within 48 hours.

### Hashtag Strategy:
- Mix broad and niche: #SEO #WebDesign + #LocalSearchAU #AISearch
- Include location when relevant: #BallaratBusiness #RegionalVIC #VictoriaAU
- Industry-specific: #TechnicalSEO #ConversionDesign #B2BMarketing
- Never exceed 4 hashtags

5 Essential Steps to Building a High-Performing Website for Regional Businesses

A website isn't just an online brochure anymore—it's your most hardworking 
salesperson. But most regional businesses are missing critical foundations 
that turn browsers into buyers.

First, structure your content around what you want to be known for, not just 
keywords. We call this Authority-Led Topic Clusters at Brighter Websites, and 
it's how our clients dominate local search results without competing on paid ads.

Second, make sure every page answers real questions your customers are asking. 
Not what you think they should know—what they're actually typing into Google 
at 11pm when they need help.

For Ballarat and regional Victoria businesses, this means incorporating local 
examples, understanding seasonal trends, and building trust through case 
studies that prove you've solved problems like theirs before.

The technical side matters too: site speed, mobile optimisation, and proper 
schema markup so AI search platforms like ChatGPT and Perplexity actually 
recommend you.

read the full guide with examples from local businesses we've helped transform.

```

### Key Rules for GBP:
- NO emojis, NO hashtags, NO clickable links in body
- CAN mention your website/shortlink as text
- Focus on educational value, not promotional
- Include location mentions (Ballarat, regional Victoria, Australia)
- Showcase local expertise and examples
- Use business name at end
- 150-300 words optimal (GBP favours longer posts)

## LINKEDIN (Professional Network)

### Format Requirements:
- **Word count:** 100-150 words
- **Emojis:** MINIMAL (1-2 max, only if natural)
- **Hashtags:** 3-5 relevant, placed at end
- **Line breaks:** YES (makes scanning easier)
- **Link:** Shortlink with context

### Tone:
- Professional but not corporate
- Can use strategic profanity ("this is the shit that matters")
- Show expertise through results/process
- Peer-to-peer, not talking down

### Structure:
```
[Strong opening - stat/problem/insight]

[Context/story - show your work]

[Lesson/takeaway]

[CTA with shortlink]

#Hashtag1 #Hashtag2 #Hashtag3
```

### Example LinkedIn Post:
```
I spent 3 hours yesterday debugging why 37 pages on our site weren't being indexed.

Not slow indexing. Complete invisibility.

Screaming Frog showed everything was crawlable. GSC said "Discovered - 
currently not indexed." The pages were solid—good content, proper structure, 
internal links.

Turns out? A single line in robots.txt was blocking our entire blog 
subdirectory. One line. Probably added during a site migration 18 months ago 
and forgotten.

Removed it Monday morning. By Wednesday, 35 of those 37 pages were indexed.

The lesson: Before you blame the algorithm, check the basics. Robots.txt, 
canonical tags, redirect chains. The boring stuff breaks more sites than 
algorithm updates ever will.

## WORD COUNT FLEXIBILITY

### Strict Targets:

- **Google Business:** 150-300 words (longer is better)
- **LinkedIn:** 100-150 words
- **Twitter:** 40-100 words
