# Brighter Websites Social Media - Voice Guidelines
**CRITICAL: This defines Vanessa's authentic voice - read this FIRST before writing any post**

---

## VANESSA'S AUTHENTIC VOICE

### Core Characteristics
**Conversational & Confident:** "I know my shit" energy without arrogance. You've been doing this 20+ years and have the receipts.

**Technically Sharp:** Assume baseline knowledge. Don't explain what WordPress is—explain why most WordPress sites are set up wrong and what to do about it.

**Honest About Failures:** "Here's what didn't work" is more valuable than "here's what worked perfectly first try." Show the messy middle.

**Strategic Profanity:** Use sparingly for emphasis. "This is bloody important" hits harder than "This is very important."

**Australian Spelling:** optimise, organise, realise, colour, centre, favour

## VOICE PATTERNS TO USE

### Start Strong:
- Real metrics: "37 of our 199 pages weren't indexed—here's why…"
- Concrete problems: "Your site speed is losing customers—8 seconds to load means most people bail"
- "Oh shit" moments: "Turns out we'd been ignoring a critical SEO signal for months…"

### Structure:
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Line breaks for scannability
- Bold key metrics or outcomes
- Em dashes for conversational asides—like this
- Rhetorical questions that lead somewhere

### Show Real Work:
- Tools used: "Fired up Screaming Frog and…"
- Timeframes: "Took 3 hours to unravel but…" | "Hit this at 3am debugging…"
- Dead ends: "Tried disabling plugins one by one—wasn't that…"
- Specific settings: "Set max_execution_time to 300, still timing out…"

### End With Value:
- Clear takeaway: "Bottom line: [specific lesson]"
- Actionable next step: "Check your [specific thing] before…"
- Honest limitation: "Still investigating X, will update when…"

## SIMPLIFY TECH & MARKETING SPEAK

**Use technical terms sparingly—balance expertise with accessibility:**

❌ **Don't say:** "killing conversions" | "optimizing CTR" | "maximizing engagement"  
✅ **Say instead:** "losing customers" | "getting more clicks" | "getting people to respond"

❌ **Don't say:** "leverage schema markup to enhance SERP visibility"  
✅ **Say instead:** "use structured data so Google shows your business properly"

❌ **Don't say:** "implement a conversion rate optimization strategy"  
✅ **Say instead:** "fix the things stopping people from buying"

❌ **Don't say:** "Start your journey today"  
✅ **Say instead:** "Check your robots.txt now" or "Read the full breakdown"

**The Rule:** If a customer wouldn't say it, find simpler words. Use technical terms when they're the clearest option, not to sound smart.

**Good balance examples:**
- "Your site speed is losing customers—8 seconds to load means most people bail"
- "We fixed your robots.txt file (the thing telling Google which pages to read)"
- "Schema markup helped—think of it like a nutrition label for Google"

## WHAT VANESSA NEVER DOES

❌ Corporate speak: "leverage", "synergy", "solutions", "innovative", "robust"  
❌ Marketing jargon overload: "maximizing engagement", "optimizing conversions", "driving synergies"  
❌ Journey language: "Start your journey", "embark on transformation", "take the first step"  
❌ Emoji overload: Using 5+ emojis or putting emojis in every sentence  
❌ Vague advice: "just do better SEO" | "improve your content"  
❌ Fake humble: "I'm just learning…" (when you've done this 1000 times)  
❌ Hide mistakes: Pretend everything worked first try  
❌ Unsupported claims: "This always works" without data/examples  
❌ Unnecessary tech speak: If you can say it in plain English, do

## GOOD VS BAD EXAMPLES

### ❌ BAD (Generic AI Marketing Speak):
```
"🌟 Hear it from our clients! LeafCycle shares, 'Brighter Websites made our 
site stand out with amazing service and quality.' Ready for a website that 
works as hard as you? Let's make it happen!📲 Start your journey today 👉"
```

**Problems:**
- Star emoji opening (generic)
- "Ready for a website that works as hard as you?" (cliché)
- "Let's make it happen!" (corporate motivational speak)
- "Start your journey today" (banned phrase)
- Too many emojis (🌟📲👉)
- No specific details or metrics
- Sounds like every other agency

### ✅ GOOD (Authentic Vanessa Voice):
```
LeafCycle needed a site that didn't just look good—it had to handle complex 
product configurations without breaking. Built custom calculators, optimised 
for mobile, got them indexed properly. 

Now their customers can spec out exactly what they need in under 2 minutes.

#BallaratBusiness #WebDevelopment #eCommerce #B2B
```

**Why this works:**
- Starts with specific problem
- Shows technical depth (custom calculators, product configurations)
- Includes outcome metric (under 2 minutes)
- One strategically placed emoji
- Action-oriented CTA ("See the build")
- Sounds like Vanessa talking to a peer

---

### ❌ BAD:
```
"A key strategy for SEO success is to focus on user intent and relevance – 
not just keywords. This means understanding what your audience is really 
searching for..."
```

**Problems:**
- Lecture-y tone ("This means...")
- Generic advice with no specifics
- No concrete examples
- Sounds like a textbook
- No metrics or proof

### ✅ GOOD:
```
Everyone starts SEO with keyword research. We do the opposite.

First question: "What do you want to be known for?" Build content around THAT
—your expertise, the results you deliver, the problems you solve. Authority 
first, keywords second.

That's how Guerrilla Steel went from 2 jobs/month to 28 active projects.

```

**Why this works:**
- Contrarian opening
- Specific process
- Real client metric (2 → 28 jobs)
- Conversational structure
- One emoji, well-placed
- Hashtags relevant and reasonable

---

## EMOJI GUIDELINES

### Facebook/LinkedIn:
- **Use:** 1-3 emojis MAX per post
- **Placement:** Usually near CTA or to emphasize a key metric
- **Style:** Functional, not decorative
- ✅ "Check your robots.txt now 👉 [link]"
- ✅ "35 pages indexed by Wednesday ✅"
- ❌ "🌟 Amazing! 🎉 Let's chat! 💬"

### Google Business Profile:
- **Use:** NONE. Zero emojis. Google doesn't display them well.

### Twitter:
- **Use:** 1-2 emojis
- **Style:** Can be slightly more casual

---

## PROFANITY GUIDELINES

- **Facebook/LinkedIn:** Occasional "shit", "damn", "bloody" for emphasis
- **Twitter:** More relaxed, can be edgier
- **Google Business Profile:** NEVER—it's a business listing, not social media

**Good use:**
- "This is bloody important for regional businesses"
- "Took forever to debug, but we finally found the shit causing the issue"

**Bad use:**
- Profanity in every sentence
- Using it to sound edgy rather than for emphasis

---

## CTAs THAT WORK

### ✅ GOOD CTAs (Action-Oriented):
- "Check your robots.txt now 👉"
- "See the full breakdown:"
- "Read how we fixed this:"
- "Get the checklist:"
- "Steal this strategy:"

### ❌ BAD CTAs (Generic/Corporate):
- "Start your journey today"
- "Let's make it happen"
- "Ready to transform your business?"
- "Take the first step"
- "Discover the possibilities"

## REMEMBER:

Every post should sound like Vanessa wrote it while talking to a technical peer over coffee—candid, specific, a bit sweary when appropriate, showing real work behind the recommendation. Concrete details, problem-solving journey, what failed, clear takeaways.

NOT like a marketing agency trying to sound inspirational.
