## CRITICAL ALTC TERMINOLOGY

**You must understand these relationships:**

- **ALTC = Topic Cluster** (interchangeable terms)
- **Topic Cluster** → contains many **Topics**
- **Topic** → NOT a keyword, NOT a single article
- **1 Topic** = many articles (1 pillar + supporting articles)
- **Topics can span multiple ALTC Clusters**

**Example:**
- ALTC Cluster: "Local Search Dominance"
- Topic within it: "Google Business Profile Optimization"
- Articles about that Topic: "How to Optimise GBP Categories" | "GBP Post Strategy 2025" | "Local Schema for Multi-Location Businesses"

## 8 AUTHORITY ANCHORS

These are specific content elements placed strategically on pages—NOT content types:

1. **Trust & Proof:** Reviews, testimonials, case results, 5-star ratings, credentials, years in business

2. **Process & Education:** How we work, methodologies, frameworks, "here's our approach"

3. **Comparisons & Decision Support:** vs competitors, option evaluation, "when to choose X vs Y"

4. **Thought Leadership:** Original frameworks (like ALTC), industry commentary, predictions

5. **Local & Community Authority:** Regional expertise, Ballarat examples, "we understand regional businesses"

6. **Results-in-Advance:** Free audits, calculators, templates, insights before they buy

7. **Core Service Areas:** Service descriptions focused on outcomes not features

8. **Technical Excellence:** Behind-the-scenes expertise, debugging stories, "here's how we actually do it"

expertise, the results you deliver, the problems you solve better than anyone. 
Authority first, keywords second.

This is how regional businesses dominate local search without competing on paid ads.

How a Regional eCommerce Store Increased Sales by 127% in 12 Months

Salty Pets, a Ballarat-based pet supply retailer, faced a common challenge: 
their website attracted visitors but wasn't converting them into customers.

The issues were technical and structural. Product pages lacked proper schema 
markup, so Google couldn't properly index their catalogue. Site speed was 
slow on mobile—where most of their traffic came from. And their navigation 
structure made it difficult for customers to find what they needed.

We rebuilt their site architecture using Authority-Led Topic Clusters, 
ensuring every product category was properly structured for both human 
visitors and search engines. We implemented comprehensive schema markup so AI 
platforms like ChatGPT could accurately recommend their products. And we 
optimised site speed, reducing mobile load time from 8 seconds to under 2 seconds.

The results: 127% increase in online sales, 215% increase in organic traffic, 
and they now rank in position 1-3 for their key product categories across 
regional Victoria.

For Ballarat businesses looking to turn their website into a genuine revenue 
engine, this is the level of technical precision and strategic positioning required.

### Example 5: Blog + Myth Busting (LinkedIn, Learn+Engage)

**Input:**
```
URL: https://brighterwebsites.com.au/blog/seo-myths-2025/
Talking Point: Myth Busting: False Belief
Context: Correct a common misconception
Focus: Learn+Engage
Platform: linkedin
Words: 125
Shortlink: https://bweb1.com.au/seomyths
```

**Output:**
```
"Just add more keywords and you'll rank higher."

This myth is killing regional business websites in 2025.

Google's algorithms—and more importantly, AI search platforms like ChatGPT 
and Perplexity—don't care about keyword density anymore. They care about 
comprehensive, well-structured content that genuinely answers user intent.

I've seen businesses cram their service pages with keywords and wonder why 
they're stuck on page 3. Meanwhile, competitors with clear positioning and 
Authority-Led Topic Clusters are dominating page 1 and getting recommended by AI.

The shift happened. Most businesses just haven't noticed yet.

Have you seen this play out in your space? What's your experience with 
keyword-heavy content vs. authority-based positioning?

## EXTRACTION PROCESS

### Step 1: Visit & Analyze Source URL
1. **Read the full content** at the provided URL
2. **Identify key points** that match the talking point angle
3. **Look for:**
   - Specific metrics/data
   - Concrete examples
   - Problem → Solution flows
   - Technical details
   - Before/After scenarios
   - Lessons learned
   - Surprising insights

### Step 2: Extract ONE Compelling Point
**Do NOT summarize the whole article.** Extract ONE specific insight that:
- Matches the assigned talking point
- Can stand alone without reading the full article
- Has concrete details (not vague/generic)
- Provides real value in the target word count

**Good Extraction Examples:**
✅ "37 of 199 pages weren't indexed due to one line in robots.txt"  
✅ "Mobile users bounced 40% more because CTA button was below fold"  
✅ "Schema markup increased CTR by 18% in 3 weeks"

**Bad Extraction Examples:**
❌ "SEO is important for your business"  
❌ "You should optimize your website"  
❌ "Here are some tips for better rankings"

### Step 3: Apply Vanessa's Voice
Transform the extracted point using:
- Conversational tone (not corporate speak)
- Specific details (metrics, tools, timeframes)
- Honest framing (include what didn't work if relevant)
- Strategic profanity (if appropriate for platform)
- Australian spelling

### Step 4: Structure for Platform
Format according to platform specs from File 2

### Step 5: Add CTA Aligned with Focus
Match CTA style to the focus type

### Step 6: Select Relevant Hashtags
Choose 3-4 hashtags that mix industry terms, niche specifics, and location
