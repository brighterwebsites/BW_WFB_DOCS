# Proprietary Terminology Reference

## Purpose

This document defines all proprietary terms, frameworks, and systems developed by Brighter Websites. These terms represent intellectual property and should be used consistently across all content, documentation, and marketing.

**Naming creates ownership** - once you name everything, competitors can't steal underlying ideas without looking derivative.

### Content Authority Map (CAM) - The Brain
**Definition**: The per-site "brain" (Layer 4 of SCOS) that aggregates all Content Architecture Records (CARs) into strategic intelligence about the entire content ecosystem. Keeps all AI tools (GPT, Claude, Social Amplification) calibrated with current strategic state.

Posibly a replacement of, extension to, or is suplementary to llms.txt - Likely for complex websites. 

"llms.txt will mainly be useful for inference, i.e. at the time a user is seeking assistance, as opposed to for training. However, perhaps if llms.txt usage becomes widespread, future training runs could take advantage of the information in llms.txt files too." reference: https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/llms-txt


**What It Tracks**:
- ALTC map (which clusters exist, maturity distribution)
- Topic saturation index
- Authority Anchors distribution across content
- Content-to-service pathway alignment
- Performance contribution to offline sales
- Content velocity and update cycles
- Internal linking maturity
- Cannibalization weak spots
- Purpose diversity, intent diversity
- AI tool calibration timestamps

**First Used**: 2024 (SCOS Layer 4 conceptualization)  
**Status**: ⚠️ Ready to build  
**Trademark**: ✅ Recommended  
**Usage**: "Content Authority Map (CAM)" or "CAM"  
**Purpose**: The "brain" that makes SCOS a true operating system, not just a plugin

**Why CAM is Perfect Naming**:
- **Pairs with CAR**: Content Architecture Record (per-post) + Content Authority Map (site-wide)
- **Emphasizes "authority"**: Core differentiator of ALTC Framework
- **"Map" metaphor**: Strategic overview, visual representation
- **No conflicts**: Doesn't conflict with Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Clean acronym**: Easy to say, memorable

**Why Critical**: Without Layer 4, AI tools drift and lose calibration every 2-3 months. CAM maintains alignment across all execution layers.

2. **Subsequent mentions**: Use acronym (ALTC, WFB, SCOS)
3. **Always capitalize** proprietary terms
4. **Link to definition** when possible

### When Creating Documentation
1. **Define terms** in glossary/definitions doc
2. **Use consistently** across all materials
3. **Cross-reference** related terms
4. **Update this document** when new terms emerge

### When Marketing
1. **Own the terminology** - use confidently
2. **Educate audience** - define terms upfront
3. **Create content around terms** - "What is ALTC?", "ALTC vs Traditional SEO"
4. **Trademark symbols** when registered (™ or ®)

## Naming Philosophy

**Why Naming Matters**:
- Creates legal, branding, and reputational ownership
- Competitors can't steal ideas without looking derivative
- Establishes you as category creator
- Makes framework memorable and shareable
- Enables certification/licensing models

**How to Name New Components**:
1. **Descriptive but unique** - "Social Amplification Loop" not "Content Distribution"
2. **Acronym-friendly** - ALTC, WFB, SCOS work well
3. **Professional not cutesy** - "Authority Anchors" not "Proof Pillars"
4. **Avoid generic terms** - "Content Engine" too generic, "ALTC Content Generator" specific
5. **Check for conflicts** - Google search before committing

**Alternative Names Needed**: MCP conflicts with Model Context Protocol - needs rename before development

---

## Decisions Needed

1. ✅ **RESOLVED: Renamed to "Content Authority Map (CAM)"**
   - Final decision: CAM (pairs with CAR, emphasizes authority, clean acronym)
   - No longer conflicts with Model Context Protocol
   - Ready for Layer 4 development

2. **Finalize CAR schema** - Current structure is conceptual, needs finalization for plugin implementation

3. **Trademark priority order** - Which terms to trademark first given budget constraints

---

## Version Control

**Current Version**: v1.0 (December 2024)  
**Last Updated**: December 4, 2024  
**Next Review**: When SCOS modules are finalized

**Change Log**:
- v1.0: Initial proprietary terminology reference created
