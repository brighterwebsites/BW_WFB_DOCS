- CAR (Content Architecture Record) detailed specification
- CAM (Content Authority Map) - what it tracks and why
- Module system and dependencies
- Performance optimization approach (disabled = not loaded)
- MCP-first design principles
- Tier system (Basic, Pro, Agency)
- Module reference (all 10+ modules documented)
- Development roadmap and phases

**Use this when**:

---

### 5. Proprietary Terminology Reference
**File**: `Proprietary-Terminology-Reference.md`

**What it covers**:
- All proprietary terms and their definitions
- Trademark priority ranking

## For Business-Specific Implementations

These framework docs are **universal**. For each client/business, create:

1. **ALTC Implementation Doc** (e.g., "ALTC Implementation - Brighter Websites")
   - Which specific ALTCs are being used
   - Maturity targets for each cluster
   - Specific Authority Anchor applications
   - Service pathway connections
   - Current state and next actions

2. **Content Engine Strategy** (e.g., "Content Engine - Brighter Websites")
   - How content flows through channels
   - Social amplification workflows
   - Email nurture sequences
   - Automation systems

3. **Brand Voice Guide** (e.g., "Brand Voice - Brighter Websites")
   - Tone and style rules
   - Humanization techniques
   - Vocabulary preferences
   - Content templates

4. **SCOS Configuration** (e.g., "SCOS Setup - Brighter Websites")
   - Which modules enabled
   - Tier selection (Basic/Pro/Agency)
   - CAR schema customizations
   - Integration settings

**These implementation docs REFERENCE the framework library but contain business-specific details.**

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Systems

These documents are designed for AI consumption. When training a new AI helper:

1. Load all three framework docs into knowledge base
2. Emphasize these are REFERENCE docs, not implementation instructions
3. Business-specific implementation comes from separate docs
4. Use precise terminology from Definitions doc
5. Apply strategic thinking from Overview doc
6. Understand context from WFB Methodology doc

### For Clients

When onboarding a new client:

1. Share **WFB Methodology** to explain overall approach
2. Share **ALTC Framework Overview** if using ALTC strategy
3. Keep **Definitions** doc as internal reference
4. Create client-specific implementation doc
5. Use framework docs as proof of systematic methodology

### For Partners/Certification

When training others to use the framework:

1. All three docs are essential reading
2. Framework docs are shareable (your IP)
3. Implementation examples show application
4. Case studies demonstrate proof
5. Certification requires demonstrating understanding

## Key Differentiators

**What makes this framework library valuable**:

1. **Systematic** - Not ad-hoc advice, but structured methodology
2. **Proven** - Guerrilla Steel case study validates approach
3. **Operational** - Precise definitions enable consistent application
4. **Reusable** - Same framework applies across clients/industries
5. **AI-native** - Designed for both human and AI consumption
6. **Intellectual Property** - Your proprietary methodology

**This is not just documentation. This is your competitive moat.**
